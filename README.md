# Data-Minig-with-RapidMiner
This project was done by `RapidMiner` in the field of `data science`; It was one of my `MSc projects`.
It is provided with the complete technical report as well as the project's files, which were done via `RapidMiner` Studio.
All steps, including `data preprocessing` and `cleansing`, to `classification` and `clustering`, are fully described in the project's report file.
The data set used in this project is about `healthcare`; we are trying to find a relevant relation between some features of the samples and their `Blood pressure feature`.
## About the dataset:

* Every sample has `15 features,` and there are over `2000 records` in the data set.
* The features are mainly about Healthcare factores of human beings.
May be useful for someone :)
