# Data-Minig-with-RapidMiner
This project was done by `RapidMiner` in the field of `data science`; It was one of my `MSc projects`.
It is provided with the complete technical report as well as the project's files, which were done via `RapidMiner` Studio.
All steps, including `data preprocessing` and `cleansing`, to `classification` and `clustering`, are fully described in the project's report file.
The data set used in this project pertains to `healthcare`; we aim to identify a relevant relationship between certain features of the samples and their `Blood pressure feature`.

## About the dataset:

* Every sample has `15 features,` and there are over `3253 records` in the data set.
* Some features are `Numerical`, such as: `age`, 'Height', and `Weight`.
* Some features are `Nominal`, such as: `gender`, and `Smoke` status.
* Each section of the project is represented via a different `.rmp` file.

#### Roadmap of the Project
1- We started for the `EDA` phase through `Section 1,2,3`
2- `preprocessing` is in `Section 4`.
3- `classification` and `clustering` selection models are described within `Section 5`.
4- We use our `best model` to train on the dataset in `Section 6`.
5- Results and Analysis are represented in `Section 7`.

Note: Full description is available through the reports files.
