This project was developed using **RapidMiner** in the field of **data science** as part of my MSc thesis. It includes a comprehensive technical report and all project files created with **RapidMiner Studio**.  

The project covers all key steps, from **data preprocessing** and **cleansing** to **classification** and **clustering**, with detailed explanations in the report file. The dataset focuses on **healthcare**, aiming to uncover relationships between specific sample features and their **blood pressure** levels.

## 📊 About the Dataset

- Each sample contains **15 features** across over **3,253 records**.
- **Numerical features** include: `Age`, `Height`, and `Weight`.
- **Nominal features** include: `Gender` and `Smoking Status`.
- Project sections are organized into separate `.rmp` files for modularity.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Covered in **Sections 1, 2, and 3**.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Detailed in **Section 4**.
3. **Model Selection**: Classification and clustering models explained in **Section 5**.
4. **Model Training**: Applying the best model to the dataset in **Section 6**.
5. **Results and Analysis**: Presented in **Section 7**.

> **Note**: For a full technical description, refer to the report files.  
> This repository may be helpful for data science enthusiasts and researchers! 🚀
