# Data-Minig-with-RapidMiner
This project is done by RapidMiner in the field of data science; It was one of my MSc projects.
It is provided with the complete technical report as well as the project's files which are done via RapidMiner studio.
All steps, including data preprocessing and cleansing to classification and clustering, are fully described in the project's report file.
The data set used in this project is about healthcare; we are trying to find a relevant relation between some features of the samples to their Blood pressure feature.
Every sample has 15 features and there are over 2000 records in the data set.
May be useful for someone :)
